      {
        question: 'What is custom website design and why is it better than templates?',
        answer: 'Custom website design means building your website from scratch without using pre-made templates. It\'s better because: 1) Unique design that matches your exact brand, 2) No template limitations, 3) Faster loading (no template bloat), 4) Better SEO (clean code), 5) Stands out from competitors using same templates.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does custom website design take in Patiala?',
        answer: 'Typical timeline is 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. Small business sites (5 pages) take 2 weeks. Medium sites (10 pages) take 3 weeks. Large custom projects take 4-5 weeks. We provide weekly progress updates and involve you in every decision.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can you match my existing brand identity in the custom design?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! We start by analyzing your logo, brand colors, fonts, and overall style. Then create a website that perfectly extends your brand identity online. If you don\'t have branding yet, we can create a complete brand identity as part of the project.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will my custom website work on all devices?',
        answer: 'Yes, guaranteed! We design mobile-first, meaning it\'s built for phones first, then adapted for tablets and desktops. Your website will look perfect on all screen sizes with no horizontal scrolling or broken layouts.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What makes your custom designs different from WordPress templates?',
        answer: 'WordPress templates: Limited by theme structure, slow loading (lots of unused code), looks similar to thousands of sites, hard to customize. Our custom designs: Built specifically for you, super fast (only code you need), 100% unique, fully flexible, modern tech stack (Next.js/React).'
      },
      {
        question: 'How much does custom website design cost in Patiala?',
        answer: 'Custom designs start from â‚¹4,999 for small business sites (5 pages). Medium business sites cost â‚¹7,999 (10 pages). Enterprise projects start at â‚¹14,999. All include free hosting setup, SEO optimization, and 1-3 months free support. No hidden costs!'
